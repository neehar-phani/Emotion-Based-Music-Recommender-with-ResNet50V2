# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommender-with-ResNet50V2
A personalized music system depending upon your current mood to cheer you up!!!!

This project uses facial emotion recognition to recommend music that matches the user's mood. It employs ResNet50V2 for emotion classification and maps the detected emotion to a predefined playlist.

Key Features
  Captures real-time image input or loads an image
  Detects emotion using a deep learning model (ResNet50V2)
  Recommends mood-based music using a simple rule-based mapping

How to Use:
  Run the notebook emotion-based-music-recommender-resnet50v2.ipynb
  Upload or capture an image of a face
  The model predicts the emotion
  A music playlist link or suggestion is provided based on the detected mood

  you can train the model using any face dataset (labled with different emotions) avilable in kaggle or any other platforms and a music playlist dataset (labled with mood of the music).
